                <p class="col-md-10" class="mt-0">Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as
                    the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little
                    book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that
                    shit. </br> </br>
                    Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt
                    with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting
                    outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you
                    see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an
                    infant named Jeb.
